## Functional Requirements for Todo List Application

This document defines the complete functional requirements for the Todo List application, based on the user's explicit need for a minimal, single-user, locally persistent task manager. All requirements are written in EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format to ensure unambiguous, testable, and implementable specifications. Backend developers must implement exactly these behaviors. No deviations, enhancements, or extensions are permitted unless explicitly approved in a future revision.

### Authentication and Session

No user authentication, registration, login, or session management is required or permitted. The system operates under a single implicit user context with no identity or account system.

- THE system SHALL allow all user interactions without requiring any credentials or user identification.
- THE system SHALL maintain no record of user identity, user session tokens, or authentication state.

### Task Creation

Users must be able to add new, text-only tasks to their todo list.

- WHEN a user enters a non-empty string of text and submits it as a new task, THE system SHALL create a new task with that exact text content and set its completion state to inactive.
- WHEN a user submits an empty string or only whitespace as a task, THE system SHALL reject the input and SHALL not create a task.
- WHEN a user submits a task containing only Unicode whitespace characters (e.g., \u00A0, \u3000), THE system SHALL treat it as empty and SHALL reject the input.
- THE system SHALL allow task titles up to 500 characters in length. Tasks exceeding 500 characters SHALL be rejected.

### Task Retrieval

Users must be able to view all tasks stored in the system.

- WHEN a user requests to view all tasks, THE system SHALL return a list of all stored tasks in ascending order of creation time (earliest first) with their text content and completion status (active/inactive).
- THE system SHALL return an empty list if no tasks have been created.
- THE system SHALL NOT sort tasks by completion status, due date, priority, or any other metadata.
- THE system SHALL NOT filter tasks by any criteria (e.g., active-only, completed-only).

### Task Status Update

Users must be able to mark a task as complete or incomplete.

- WHEN a user selects an existing task and marks it as completed, THE system SHALL update the task’s state from inactive to active.
- WHEN a user selects a task already marked as completed and requests to mark it as incomplete, THE system SHALL update the task’s state from active to inactive.
- WHEN a user attempts to update the status of a task that no longer exists, THE system SHALL ignore the request and SHALL maintain all existing task data unchanged.
- THE system SHALL NOT permit the status of a task to be updated to any state other than active or inactive.

### Task Deletion

Users must be able to permanently remove tasks from the list.

- WHEN a user selects an existing task and requests to delete it, THE system SHALL permanently remove that task from storage.
- WHEN a user requests to delete a task that does not exist in the system, THE system SHALL ignore the request and SHALL maintain all existing data unchanged.
- THE system SHALL NOT archive, hide, or move deleted tasks. Deletion SHALL be permanent and irreversible.
- THE system SHALL NOT prompt for confirmation before deletion.

### Data Persistence

The application must retain tasks between sessions without external synchronization.

- WHEN the user closes the application and reopens it, THE system SHALL restore all previously created, modified, and un-deleted tasks exactly as they were before closure.
- THE system SHALL store data locally on the user’s device using persistent storage methods (e.g., file system, local database, local storage).
- THE system SHALL NOT synchronize tasks with any remote server, cloud service, or other device.
- WHERE the user chooses to delete the application, THE system SHALL permanently erase all locally stored todo data.

### Performance Expectations

User interactions with the todo list must feel immediate and responsive.

- WHEN a user adds, updates, or deletes a single task, THE system SHALL reflect the change in the interface within one second.
- WHEN a user retrieves all tasks when fewer than 500 tasks exist, THE system SHALL display the full list within one second.
- WHILE the user is actively entering a new task, THE system SHALL not delay input or inhibit typing.

### Data Uniqueness

Tasks are identified by their position in the list and their text content. No duplicate detection or deduplication is required.

- THE system SHALL permit multiple tasks with identical text content to exist simultaneously.
- THE system SHALL NOT treat task titles as case-sensitive for uniqueness purposes.
- WHERE a task title contains mixed case (e.g., "Buy milk" and "buy MILK"), THE system SHALL treat them as separate tasks.

### Error Handling and Edge Conditions

The system SHALL respond predictably to invalid, malformed, or unexpected inputs.

- IF a user attempts to perform any action (create, update, delete, retrieve) on a task identifier that does not exist, THEN THE system SHALL ignore the request and SHALL maintain all system data unchanged.
- IF the local storage becomes unavailable or corrupted (e.g., disk full, file permissions denied), THEN THE system SHALL prevent further task modifications and SHALL display a single, non-technical error message: ‘Could not save tasks — please restart the app.’
- IF the application crashes during an update (e.g., power loss, forced close), THEN THE system SHALL restore the task list to its state as of the last successful save, without partial updates or data loss.

### Summary of Compliance

This document contains exactly eight functional requirements, all expressed in EARS format. No backend developer may add, remove, or modify the described behaviors. The system shall not support tagging, due dates, priority levels, categories, shared access, cloud backup, or any feature beyond the scope described herein. This document defines the complete and final functional surface of the Todo List application.
