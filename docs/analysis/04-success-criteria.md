## Primary Success Metrics

THE todoList application SHALL be considered successful when a user can complete the following core actions without encountering errors or confusion:

- WHEN a user opens the application, THE system SHALL display an empty task list with a clear prompt to add their first task.
- WHEN a user types a task name (e.g., "Buy groceries") and submits it, THE system SHALL immediately add the task to their list and display it visible below the input field.
- WHEN a user selects a task from the list and toggles its status, THE system SHALL visually indicate completion (e.g., strikethrough text) and persist this status across sessions.
- WHEN a user selects a task and chooses to delete it, THE system SHALL immediately remove the task from the list and permanently erase it from local storage.
- WHILE the user is actively using the application, THE system SHALL retain all created, updated, and deleted tasks between launches, even after closing and reopening the app.

Success is measured when 100% of these interactions are executable by a novice user on the first attempt, without documentation, instructions, or assistance.

## User Experience Benchmarks

THE todoList application SHALL provide a perfectly intuitive user experience characterized by:

- Immediate visual feedback for every user action (add, toggle, delete)
- Zero loading screens or spinners — all interactions must feel instantaneous
- No pop-ups, confirmations, or dialogs unless absolutely necessary (e.g., deleting a task has no confirmation prompt — it is immediate)
- No unclear terminology — all buttons and labels use plain, common English words ("Add", "Done", "Delete", "Your List")
- No visual clutter — the interface shall contain only an input field, a task list, and a clear visual distinction between active and completed tasks
- The entire experience must feel like using a physical notepad: open it, write something, check it off, tear it out — and it stays done.

A user shall consider the experience "excellent" if they can complete their first task in under five seconds after launching the app for the first time.

## Reliability and Availability

THE todoList application SHALL guarantee that:

- WHEN a user adds, updates, or deletes a task, THE system SHALL ensure the change survives a full device reboot.
- IF the application crashes during an operation (e.g., due to unexpected system interruption), THE system SHALL recover the last known valid state of the task list without data loss.
- WHERE a user attempts to create a task with zero characters (empty input), THE system SHALL decline the action without error message (soft failure).
- WHERE a user deletes a task, THE system SHALL never restore it unless the user re-creates it manually.
- WHILE the application is running, THE system SHALL process all user actions in real time with no delays, lags, or unresponsiveness.

The application is considered reliable when a user can entrust it with daily personal tasks (e.g., remembering grocery lists, appointments, or chores) for one month without ever experiencing a data loss or behavioral inconsistency.

## Future Expansion Boundaries

THE todoList application SHALL explicitly NOT include any of the following features, even if suggested by users or stakeholders:

- Shared tasks or collaboration with other users
- Cloud syncing or backup to remote servers
- Due dates, reminders, or time-based notifications
- Categories, labels, or priority levels
- Search, filter, or sorting functions
- Mobile app, web app, or desktop app variant as separate entities
- User accounts, login, or email verification
- Themes, color schemes, or custom layouts
- Analytics, usage tracking, or telemetry
- Task recurrence or weekly planning
- Integration with email, calendars, or other applications

WHERE a future request is made to add any of the above features, THE system SHALL maintain its minimal design philosophy and refuse feature expansion — preserving its identity as a digital notepad, not a productivity suite.

The sole success of this system is defined by its simplicity and its ability to reliably remember what the user wrote down — nothing more, nothing less.
