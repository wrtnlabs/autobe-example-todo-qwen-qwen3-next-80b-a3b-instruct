# Authentication Requirements

### Core Authentication Functions
- Users must authenticate with a valid email address and password to access the Todo List application
- THE system SHALL reject any attempt to access features without prior authentication
- THE system SHALL NOT allow guest or anonymous access under any circumstances

### Authentication Process
WHEN a user attempts to log in, THE system SHALL:
- Accept a valid email address (standard RFC 5322 format) and password
- Hash the provided password using industry-standard bcrypt algorithm with cost factor 12
- Compare the hashed input against the stored hash for the email
- IF the credentials match, THE system SHALL generate a JWT token with user identity and role information
- IF the credentials do not match, THE system SHALL return an error message "Invalid email or password" and SHALL NOT disclose whether the email exists in the system
- IF the user account is disabled or deleted, THE system SHALL return an error message "Account not found"

## User Role Definition

### Single User Role: member
- The system SHALL have exactly one user role: "member"
- THE member role SHALL have full ownership and control over all todo items created by that user
- THE member role SHALL be permitted to: create, read, update, and delete their own todo items
- THE member role SHALL NOT be permitted to access, view, or manipulate any todo items created by other users
- THE member role SHALL NOT have administrative privileges or access to system settings

### Role-Based Access Control
WHEN a user attempts to perform any action on a todo item, THE system SHALL:
- Extract the user ID from the authentication token
- Verify that the todo item's owner ID matches the authenticated user ID
- IF the owner IDs match, THE system SHALL permit the requested action
- IF the owner IDs do not match, THE system SHALL reject the request with status code 403 Forbidden and error message "Access denied: You do not own this todo item"

## Session Management

### Token Issuance
WHEN a user successfully authenticates, THE system SHALL:
- Issue a JWT access token with the following payload structure:
  - userId: unique identifier for the user (UUID format)
  - role: "member" (string literal)
  - issuedAt: timestamp in ISO 8601 format
  - expiresAt: timestamp in ISO 8601 format (30 minutes after issuance)
- The JWT secret key SHALL be environment-variable protected and never hardcoded
- THE system SHALL NOT store tokens on the server

### Token Expiration
WHILE a user session is active, THE system SHALL:
- Validate the expiration timestamp in every incoming JWT token
- IF the token has expired (current time > expiresAt), THE system SHALL reject the request with status code 401 Unauthorized
- THE system SHALL NOT automatically refresh expired tokens
- WHEN a user's token expires, THE system SHALL require the user to re-authenticate

### Session Inactivity Timeout
WHILE a user is authenticated, THE system SHALL:
- Track the time of the last active request for each authenticated session
- IF 30 minutes pass without any request from the user, THE system SHALL invalidate the session
- THE system SHALL automatically clear the token from client storage upon session timeout
- WHEN a session times out due to inactivity, THE system SHALL redirect the user to the login screen

### Logout Functionality
WHEN a user initiates a logout action, THE system SHALL:
- Immediately clear the JWT access token from client storage (localStorage or cookie)
- THE system SHALL NOT invalidate tokens on the server (stateless design)
- THE system SHALL return a success status to confirm logout
- THE system SHALL redirect the user to the login page

## Data Ownership

### User Data Isolation
THE system SHALL enforce absolute data isolation between users:
- Each todo item SHALL be permanently associated with a single user ID (UUID)
- WHEN a todo item is created, THE system SHALL automatically assign the authenticated user's ID as the owner
- WHEN a todo item is queried, THE system SHALL automatically filter results to include only items belonging to the authenticated user
- THE system SHALL NOT store any user-to-user relationships, shared lists, or collaborative features

### Data Ownership Validation
IF a request attempts to access or modify a todo item, THEN THE system SHALL:
- Verify that the item's ownerID matches the authenticated user's ID
- IF the ownerID does not match, THEN THE system SHALL return 403 Forbidden without logging the attempted access
- THE system SHALL NOT expose any metadata indicating the existence of items belonging to other users

## Security Compliance

### Password Storage
THE system SHALL:
- Use bcrypt algorithm with a cost factor of 12 for password hashing
- NEVER store passwords in plain text, reversible encryption, or weak hashing algorithms
- Generate a unique salt for each user's password
- Store only the hashed password and salt (as combined hash string)
- Ensure password requirements are enforced at the application layer (minimum 8 characters, no system-wide restrictions on complexity beyond length)

### Data Transmission Security
WHEN data is transmitted between client and server, THE system SHALL:
- Use HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- NEVER transmit any data over unencrypted HTTP
- Include HSTS headers with a minimum age of 1 year
- Set secure flag on all cookies (if used for storage)

### Client-Side Token Security
THE system SHALL:
- Store JWT tokens in localStorage (not cookies) to enable convenient persistence
- Apply Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent XSS attacks
- Sanitize all user input before storage or display to prevent XSS vectors
- Implement automatic token clearance on logout and session timeout

### Data Persistence Security
THE system SHALL:
- Ensure that todo item data is stored using database-level access controls
- Implement row-level security so users cannot access rows owned by other users
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest using AES-256 encryption
- Implement audit logging of authentication attempts (success/failure) without logging passwords or tokens

### Compliance Statement
THE system SHALL comply with all applicable data protection regulations, ensuring:
- Users own their data exclusively
- No user data is shared, sold, or transmitted to third-party services
- No analytics, tracking, or advertising is implemented
- All data resides solely on the user's device or secure server infrastructure controlled by the service owner

### External Service Prohibition
THE system SHALL NOT:
- Communicate with any external servers, APIs, or services
- Send data to analytics platforms, advertising networks, or cloud services
- Implement third-party authentication (OAuth, Google Sign-In, etc.)
- Use external storage services for user data

### Accessibility Requirements
THE system SHALL ensure:
- All user interface elements can be operated using keyboard navigation
- Text contrast ratios meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Screen readers can accurately interpret all content
- Error messages are presented in both visual and programmatic ways

### Privacy Statement
WHEN a user creates or modifies a todo item, THE system SHALL:
- Not collect or store any personally identifiable information beyond the user's authentication email (which the user provides)
- Not track user behavior, usage patterns, session durations, or interaction metrics
- Not build any user profiles or attempt to infer user characteristics
- Not share data with any external entities under any circumstances
- Store data solely to enable the user's personal task management
