# Todo List Application - Requirement Analysis Report

## System Overview

The Todo List application is a minimal, single-user productivity tool designed to capture and manage simple text-based tasks with zero complexity. This system is not a project manager, not a calendar, not a collaboration platform. It exists solely to help individuals remember what they need to do — and nothing more. The application operates entirely on the user's local device, with no network connectivity, cloud synchronization, user accounts, or data sharing capability. All user data persists only within the confines of the device's local storage, and is permanently lost if the application is uninstalled or the device is reset. This intentional fragility is a core design constraint to prevent feature creep and ensure the application remains focused, reliable, and simple.

## User Role

There is exactly one user role: "user". This role represents the sole person who interacts with the application. There is no authentication, no login, no password, no profile, no account, no identity verification. The system does not recognize who is using it — it merely responds to input. If the application is opened on a different device or browser, the task list is empty — and this is deliberate. The system does not attempt to identify, track, or recover user identity. There are no user roles, permissions, or access levels. The "user" is not an entity — it is the moment of interaction.

## Functional Requirements

All user interactions with the system are restricted to four essential operations. Every requirement is defined using the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format to ensure clarity, testability, and implementation precision.

### Task Creation

WHEN a user enters a non-empty string of text into the input field and submits it, THE system SHALL create a new task with that exact text content and set its completion state to incomplete.

WHEN a user submits a string that consists of only whitespace characters (e.g., "    "), THE system SHALL reject the input and SHALL NOT create a task.

WHEN a user submits a task that exceeds 500 characters, THE system SHALL truncate the content to the first 500 characters and create the task.

WHEN a user submits a task containing only Unicode whitespace characters (such as \u00A0 or \u3000), THE system SHALL treat it the same as an empty string and SHALL reject it.

### Task Retrieval

WHEN a user opens the application, THE system SHALL display all previously created tasks in the order they were added (oldest at the bottom, newest at the top).

THE system SHALL return an empty list if no tasks have ever been created.

THE system SHALL NOT sort, group, filter, or search tasks under any circumstances.

THE system SHALL NOT hide completed tasks. All tasks — active and completed — are always visible in the same list.

### Task Status Update

WHEN a user toggles the checkbox next to a task from unchecked to checked, THE system SHALL update the task's status from incomplete to completed, apply strikethrough formatting to its text, and persist this change.

WHEN a user toggles the checkbox next to a task from checked to unchecked, THE system SHALL update the task's status from completed to incomplete, remove strikethrough formatting, and persist this change.

WHEN a user attempts to toggle the status of a task that does not exist in the system, THE system SHALL silently ignore the request and maintain all data unchanged.

THE system SHALL NOT permit any new state beyond "incomplete" and "completed".

THE system SHALL NOT allow the text of a completed task to be modified directly. To edit, the user must delete and re-add the task.

### Task Deletion

WHEN a user selects the "X" button next to a task, THE system SHALL permanently remove that task from the list.

WHEN a user attempts to delete a task that does not exist, THE system SHALL silently ignore the request with no feedback, error, or notification.

THE system SHALL NOT provide an undo function, trash bin, or recovery mechanism.

THE system SHALL NOT allow deletion via drag-and-drop, long press on task text, or bulk actions.

### Data Persistence

WHEN the user closes the application or shuts down the device, THE system SHALL ensure all task data — including titles and completion states — is written to persistent local storage.

WHEN the user reopens the application after any shutdown or crash, THE system SHALL restore the complete task list to its exact state before closure, including all completion statuses.

THE system SHALL NOT use remote servers, cloud storage, API calls, or synchronization services under any condition.

WHERE the user uninstalls the application, THE system SHALL permanently erase all locally stored task data — no backup, no export, no transfer.

### Performance Expectations

WHEN a user performs an action (add, toggle, or delete a task), THE system SHALL update the user interface within one second.

WHEN a user opens the application with fewer than 500 tasks stored, THE system SHALL render the full list within one second.

WHEN a user types into the input field, THE system SHALL not delay, lag, or block input — the user experience must feel instantaneous.

## Business Rules and Constraints

The following business rules govern system behavior to ensure consistent and predictable user experience.

### Task Validation

THE system SHALL accept only string values for task titles. Any non-string input (e.g., numbers, objects) SHALL be rejected.

THE system SHALL trim leading and trailing whitespace from task titles before storage.

THE system SHALL disallow task titles longer than 500 characters. Any input exceeding this limit SHALL be truncated.

### State Management

WHEN a task is created, THE system SHALL assign the default state of incomplete.

WHILE a task exists, THE system SHALL allow its state to change only between incomplete and completed.

THE system SHALL NOT permit users to create, edit, or manipulate any metadata such as due date, priority, category, color, or tags.

### Data Uniqueness

THE system SHALL allow multiple tasks with identical text content to exist simultaneously.

THE system SHALL NOT treat task titles as case-sensitive for uniqueness purposes. "Buy milk" and "buy milk" MAY coexist as distinct tasks.

THE system SHALL NOT deduplicate tasks or suggest merges, even when identical text is re-added.

### Error Handling

IF a task creation request is invalid (empty, whitespace, over 500 characters), THE system SHALL NOT display an error message to the user.

IF a task update or deletion request targets a non-existent task, THE system SHALL ignore the request without feedback.

IF local storage becomes unavailable (e.g., disk full), THE system SHALL display a single, non-technical message: "Could not save tasks — please restart the app."

IF the application crashes mid-operation, THE system SHALL restore the last known valid state of the task list upon restart — with no partial updates or data corruption.

### Session Integrity

THE system SHALL persist data to local storage immediately after every user-initiated change (add, toggle, delete).

WHEN the application is closed or terminated, THE system SHALL ensure that every pending change has been written to storage before exiting.

THE system SHALL maintain memory consistency between the displayed list and the persisted data at all times.

THE system SHALL not initiate any background processes, timers, syncs, or network transmissions.

## Success Criteria

The Todo List application achieves success only when it meets the following measurable, user-perceivable benchmarks.

### Primary Success Metrics

THE user SHALL be able to add a new task in under three seconds on first use.

THE user SHALL be able to view their complete list of tasks immediately upon launching the application.

THE user SHALL be able to mark a task as completed or delete it in two or fewer actions.

THE user SHALL not require any tutorial, help text, or onboarding message to understand how to use the application.

### User Experience Benchmarks

THE application SHALL launch faster than the device unlock time.

THE application SHALL display changes immediately upon user interaction — no loading spinners, progress bars, or delays.

THE interface SHALL contain no extraneous elements — only a single input field and a plain list of tasks with checkboxes.

THE user SHALL never encounter a configuration screen, settings menu, preferences dialog, or theme selector.

### Reliability and Availability

THE system SHALL survive full device reboots without data loss.

THE system SHALL survive forced application exits and crashes with perfect data integrity.

THE system SHALL lose data only if the app is uninstalled by the user or the device is factory reset.

### Future Expansion Boundaries

WHERE the user requests cloud sync, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.

WHERE the user requests due dates, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.

WHERE the user requests task priorities, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.

WHERE the user requests labels or categories, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.

WHERE the user requests search, filter, or sort functionality, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.

WHERE the user requests sharing with others, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.

WHERE the user requests export or import of data, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.

WHERE the user requests account creation or login, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.

WHERE the user requests dark mode or visual customization, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.

WHERE the user requests notification alarms, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.

The Todo List application’s greatest strength is its deliberate refusal to grow. Success is measured not by features added, but by features resisted. This document defines the complete, final, and unmodifiable functional specification.
