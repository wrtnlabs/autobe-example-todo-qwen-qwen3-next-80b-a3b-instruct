## Performance Requirements

WHEN a user creates a new todo item, THE system SHALL display the item in the list within 500 milliseconds after the user submits the input.

WHEN a user toggles the completion status of a todo item, THE system SHALL update the visual state and persist the change within 500 milliseconds.

WHEN a user edits the title of a todo item, THE system SHALL save the updated title and reflect the change in the UI within 500 milliseconds.

WHEN a user deletes a todo item, THE system SHALL remove it from the list and update the display within 500 milliseconds.

WHEN a user clears all completed items, THE system SHALL remove all completed items from the list and update the display within 1 second.

WHEN the system loads the initial todo list for a user, THE system SHALL display the list within 1 second after the application is launched.

WHILE the application is performing any operation (creating, updating, deleting, or loading items), THE system SHALL display a visual loading indicator to prevent multiple concurrent user actions.

WHEN a user performs any action with the application, THE system SHALL respond with a perceptible feedback tone or animation to confirm the action has been received, even if the operation has not yet completed.

## Availability Requirements

THE system SHALL be accessible on any modern web browser including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

THE system SHALL be usable on any device with a screen size of 320px width or larger, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.

THE system SHALL function completely while offline. All user actions (create, update, delete, toggle) that occur while offline SHALL be stored locally and synchronized automatically when network connectivity is restored.

THE system SHALL maintain user data integrity even if the device battery is completely drained during use. All data changes SHALL be persisted to persistent storage immediately after the operation is initiated by the user.

THE system SHALL have no scheduled maintenance windows. User data SHALL always be available and accessible.

## Data Persistence Requirements

THE system SHALL persist all todo items in encrypted local storage on the user’s device.

ALL user data SHALL be stored exclusively on the device where the application is used. NO user data SHALL be transmitted to any server or external service.

WHEN a user interacts with any todo item (create, edit, delete, toggle status), THE system SHALL persist the change to local storage within 100 milliseconds.

THE system SHALL guarantee zero data loss due to application crashes, system reboots, or unexpected power loss.

WHEN the device storage is full, THE system SHALL notify the user with a clear message, but SHALL NOT delete any existing todo items.

THE system SHALL maintain a backup of all data in a secondary cache on the device and use the backup to recover data if the primary storage is corrupted.

## Error Handling Requirements

IF the device storage becomes inaccessible during a write operation, THEN THE system SHALL display a clear message: "Your device storage is unavailable. Please check your device settings and try again."

IF the application fails to synchronize data because of network failure after a change has been made while offline, THEN THE system SHALL display: "Unable to sync. Changes saved locally. Will retry when online."

IF a user attempts to create a todo item with a title longer than 255 characters, THEN THE system SHALL prevent submission and display: "Title is too long. Maximum 255 characters allowed."

IF a user attempts to create a todo item with an empty or whitespace-only title, THEN THE system SHALL prevent submission and display: "Please enter a title for your task."

IF the application fails to load initial data on startup due to corrupted local storage, THEN THE system SHALL display: "Your data appears corrupted. A new empty list will be created. Your previous data cannot be recovered."

IF a user attempts to delete a todo item while the system is offline, THEN THE system SHALL proceed with local deletion and display: "Deleted. Will sync when online."

## Accessibility Requirements

THE system SHALL support screen readers by providing proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML elements for all interactive controls.

WHEN a todo item’s status is toggled, THE system SHALL announce the change to screen readers: "Task [title] marked as [completed or active]."

THE system SHALL provide keyboard navigation for all interface elements:

- Tab to navigate between todo items, Add button, and Clear button
- Enter or Space to toggle item status
- Delete key to delete focused item
- Escape to cancel editing

WHEN a user focuses on a todo item title for editing, THE system SHALL automatically select the entire text content unless the user has already selected a portion.

THE system SHALL support high contrast mode and ensure all UI text and controls maintain sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1) in both light and dark modes.

THE system SHALL not rely on color alone to convey information (e.g., status must be indicated by both color and text/icon).

## Privacy Requirements

THE system SHALL NOT collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII).

THE system SHALL NOT transmit any usage data, metrics, or analytics to any third party.

THE system SHALL NOT access or require any device permissions beyond local storage.

THE system SHALL NOT include any third-party scripts, APIs, SDKs, or trackers.

IF a user exports their todo list, THE system SHALL generate a file containing only item titles and statuses — with no timestamps, identifiers, or device information.

WHEN a user clears data from the application, THE system SHALL permanently remove all local data and render it unrecoverable by any means.

THE system SHALL be completely self-contained. No authentication, login, or synchronization with any external service is permitted.

## Digital Accessibility Statement

This application is designed for personal, offline use. All data is stored locally on the user’s device with no external connection. No user activity is monitored, logged, or transmitted. The application has no network dependencies and requires no registration, email, or identity verification. No external services are involved in any operation. The user owns and controls all data completely.
