Since you're not familiar with programming and would like a **minimum viable Todo list application**, I'll help you define the simplest possible version — just enough to create, read, update, and delete tasks.\n\nLet me first confirm your needs with a few simple questions. Don't worry about technical terms — I’ll guide you through this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### 📝 Simple Questions to Define Your Todo List\n\n1. **What is the main goal of your Todo list?**  \n   (e.g., Just to remember daily tasks? Or also track completed items?)\n\n2. **Do you want to log each task with a title only?**  \n   (e.g., “Buy milk” — that’s it. Or do you also want to add due dates, notes, or priority levels?)\n\n3. **Should tasks stay saved even if you close the app?**  \n   (We’ll need a simple database to remember them — but no need for cloud accounts or logins unless you want them.)\n\n4. **Will only one person use this list?**  \n   (For now, let’s assume it's just for you — no sharing or multiple users.)\n\n5. **What are the minimum actions you want to do with your tasks?**  \n   Thought of as:\n   - ✅ Add a new task  \n   - 📋 See all your tasks  \n   - ✅ Mark a task as done  \n   - ❌ Delete a task  \n\n   → Is that enough? Or do you need other features?\n\n---\n\nOnce you answer these, I’ll write a **clear, non-technical Requirements Analysis Report** just for you — no jargon, just plain English.\n\nThen, I’ll automatically build the entire app behind the scenes, including a working API and user interface — all you'll need to do is run it.\n\nPlease reply with your answers to the 5 questions above. I’m here to help you make this simple and perfect for your needs 💪","created_at":"2025-09-30T11:48:54.212Z","completed_at":"2025-09-30T11:48:55.954Z"},{"id":"01999a74-4830-72ca-b547-8f6274008190","type":"userMessage","contents":[{"type":"text","text":"I'm not familiar with the analyze feature.

This system is not a project manager, not a calendar, not a collaboration platform. It exists solely to help individuals remember what they need to do — and nothing more. The application operates entirely on the user's local device, with no network connectivity, cloud synchronization, user accounts, or data sharing capability. All user data persists only within the confines of the device's local storage, and is permanently lost if the application is uninstalled or the device is reset. This intentional fragility is a core design constraint to prevent feature creep and ensure the application remains focused, reliable, and simple.\n\n## User Role\n\nThere is exactly one user role: \"user\". This role represents the sole person who interacts with the application. There is no authentication, no login, no password, no profile, no account, no identity verification. The system does not recognize who is using it — it merely responds to input. If the application is opened on a different device or browser, the task list is empty — and this is deliberate. The system does not attempt to identify, track, or recover user identity. There are no user roles, permissions, or access levels. The \"user\" is not an entity — it is the moment of interaction.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\nAll user interactions with the system are restricted to four essential operations. Every requirement is defined using the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format to ensure clarity, testability, and implementation precision.\n\n### Task Creation\n\nWHEN a user enters a non-empty string of text into the input field and submits it, THE system SHALL create a new task with that exact text content and set its completion state to incomplete.\n\nWHEN a user submits a string that consists of only whitespace characters (e.g., \"    \"), THE system SHALL reject the input and SHALL NOT create a task.\n\nWHEN a user submits a task that exceeds 500 characters, THE system SHALL truncate the content to the first 500 characters and create the task.\n\nWHEN a user submits a task containing only Unicode whitespace characters (such as \\u00A0 or \\u3000), THE system SHALL treat it the same as an empty string and SHALL reject it.\n\n### Task Retrieval\n\nWHEN a user opens the application, THE system SHALL display all previously created tasks in the order they were added (oldest at the bottom, newest at the top).\n\nTHE system SHALL return an empty list if no tasks have ever been created.\n\nTHE system SHALL NOT sort, group, filter, or search tasks under any circumstances.\n\nTHE system SHALL NOT hide completed tasks. All tasks — active and completed — are always visible in the same list.\n\n### Task Status Update\n\nWHEN a user toggles the checkbox next to a task from unchecked to checked, THE system SHALL update the task's status from incomplete to completed, apply strikethrough formatting to its text, and persist this change.\n\nWHEN a user toggles the checkbox next to a task from checked to unchecked, THE system SHALL update the task's status from completed to incomplete, remove strikethrough formatting, and persist this change.\n\nWHEN a user attempts to toggle the status of a task that does not exist in the system, THE system SHALL silently ignore the request and maintain all data unchanged.\n\nTHE system SHALL NOT permit any new state beyond \"incomplete\" and \"completed\".\n\nTHE system SHALL NOT allow the text of a completed task to be modified directly. To edit, the user must delete and re-add the task.\n\n### Task Deletion\n\nWHEN a user selects the \"X\" button next to a task, THE system SHALL permanently remove that task from the list.\n\nWHEN a user attempts to delete a task that does not exist, THE system SHALL silently ignore the request with no feedback, error, or notification.\n\nTHE system SHALL NOT provide an undo function, trash bin, or recovery mechanism.\n\nTHE system SHALL NOT allow deletion via drag-and-drop, long press on task text, or bulk actions.\n\n### Data Persistence\n\nWHEN the user closes the application or shuts down the device, THE system SHALL ensure all task data — including titles and completion states — is written to persistent local storage.\n\nWHEN the user reopens the application after any shutdown or crash, THE system SHALL restore the complete task list to its exact state before closure, including all completion statuses.\n\nTHE system SHALL NOT use remote servers, cloud storage, API calls, or synchronization services under any condition.\n\nWHERE the user uninstalls the application, THE system SHALL permanently erase all locally stored task data — no backup, no export, no transfer.\n\n### Performance Expectations\n\nWHEN a user performs an action (add, toggle, or delete a task), THE system SHALL update the user interface within one second.\n\nWHEN a user opens the application with fewer than 500 tasks stored, THE system SHALL render the full list within one second.\n\nWHEN a user types into the input field, THE system SHALL not delay, lag, or block input — the user experience must feel instantaneous.\n\n## Business Rules and Constraints\n\nThe following business rules govern system behavior to ensure consistent and predictable user experience.\n\n### Task Validation\n\nTHE system SHALL accept only string values for task titles. Any non-string input (e.g., numbers, objects) SHALL be rejected.\n\nTHE system SHALL trim leading and trailing whitespace from task titles before storage.\n\nTHE system SHALL disallow task titles longer than 500 characters. Any input exceeding this limit SHALL be truncated.\n\n### State Management\n\nWHEN a task is created, THE system SHALL assign the default state of incomplete.\n\nWHILE a task exists, THE system SHALL allow its state to change only between incomplete and completed.\n\nTHE system SHALL NOT permit users to create, edit, or manipulate any metadata such as due date, priority, category, color, or tags.\n\n### Data Uniqueness\n\nTHE system SHALL allow multiple tasks with identical text content to exist simultaneously.\n\nTHE system SHALL NOT treat task titles as case-sensitive for uniqueness purposes. \"Buy milk\" and \"buy milk\" MAY coexist as distinct tasks.\n\nTHE system SHALL NOT deduplicate tasks or suggest merges, even when identical text is re-added.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nIF a task creation request is invalid (empty, whitespace, over 500 characters), THE system SHALL NOT display an error message to the user.\n\nIF a task update or deletion request targets a non-existent task, THE system SHALL ignore the request without feedback.\n\nIF local storage becomes unavailable (e.g., disk full), THE system SHALL display a single, non-technical message: \"Could not save tasks — please restart the app.\"\n\nIF the application crashes mid-operation, THE system SHALL restore the last known valid state of the task list upon restart — with no partial updates or data corruption.\n\n### Session Integrity\n\nTHE system SHALL persist data to local storage immediately after every user-initiated change (add, toggle, delete).\n\nWHEN the application is closed or terminated, THE system SHALL ensure that every pending change has been written to storage before exiting.\n\nTHE system SHALL maintain memory consistency between the displayed list and the persisted data at all times.\n\nTHE system SHALL not initiate any background processes, timers, syncs, or network transmissions.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nThe Todo List application achieves success only when it meets the following measurable, user-perceivable benchmarks.\n\n### Primary Success Metrics\n\nTHE user SHALL be able to add a new task in under three seconds on first use.\n\nTHE user SHALL be able to view their complete list of tasks immediately upon launching the application.\n\nTHE user SHALL be able to mark a task as completed or delete it in two or fewer actions.\n\nTHE user SHALL not require any tutorial, help text, or onboarding message to understand how to use the application.\n\n### User Experience Benchmarks\n\nTHE application SHALL launch faster than the device unlock time.\n\nTHE application SHALL display changes immediately upon user interaction — no loading spinners, progress bars, or delays.\n\nTHE interface SHALL contain no extraneous elements — only a single input field and a plain list of tasks with checkboxes.\n\nTHE user SHALL never encounter a configuration screen, settings menu, preferences dialog, or theme selector.\n\n### Reliability and Availability\n\nTHE system SHALL survive full device reboots without data loss.\n\nTHE system SHALL survive forced application exits and crashes with perfect data integrity.\n\nTHE system SHALL lose data only if the app is uninstalled by the user or the device is factory reset.\n\n### Future Expansion Boundaries\n\nWHERE the user requests cloud sync, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.\n\nWHERE the user requests due dates, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.\n\nWHERE the user requests task priorities, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.\n\nWHERE the user requests labels or categories, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.\n\nWHERE the user requests search, filter, or sort functionality, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.\n\nWHERE the user requests sharing with others, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.\n\nWHERE the user requests export or import of data, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.\n\nWHERE the user requests account creation or login, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.\n\nWHERE the user requests dark mode or visual customization, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.\n\nWHERE the user requests notification alarms, THE system SHALL NOT implement it.\n\nThe Todo List application’s greatest strength is its deliberate refusal to grow. Success is measured not by features added, but by features resisted.

following core actions without encountering errors or confusion:\n\n- WHEN a user opens the application, THE system SHALL display an empty task list with a clear prompt to add their first task.\n- WHEN a user types a task name (e.g., \"Buy groceries\") and submits it, THE system SHALL immediately add the task to their list and display it visible below the input field.\n- WHEN a user selects a task from the list and toggles its status, THE system SHALL visually indicate completion (e.g., strikethrough text) and persist this status across sessions.\n- WHEN a user selects a task and chooses to delete it, THE system SHALL immediately remove the task from the list and permanently erase it from local storage.\n- WHILE the user is actively using the application, THE system SHALL retain all created, updated, and deleted tasks between launches, even after closing and reopening the app.\n\nSuccess is measured when 100% of these interactions are executable by a novice user on the first attempt, without documentation, instructions, or assistance.\n\n## User Experience Benchmarks\n\nTHE todoList application SHALL provide a perfectly intuitive user experience characterized by:\n\n- Immediate visual feedback for every user action (add, toggle, delete)\n- Zero loading screens or spinners — all interactions must feel instantaneous\n- No pop-ups, confirmations, or dialogs unless absolutely necessary (e.g., deleting a task has no confirmation prompt — it is immediate)\n- No unclear terminology — all buttons and labels use plain, common English words (\"Add\", \"Done\", \"Delete\", \"Your List\")\n- No visual clutter — the interface shall contain only an input field, a task list, and a clear visual distinction between active and completed tasks\n- The entire experience must feel like using a physical notepad: open it, write something, check it off, tear it out — and it stays done.\n\nA user shall consider the experience \"excellent\" if they can complete their first task in under five seconds after launching the app for the first time.\n\n## Reliability and Availability\n\nTHE todoList application SHALL guarantee that:\n\n- WHEN a user adds, updates, or deletes a task, THE system SHALL ensure the change survives a full device reboot.\n- IF the application crashes during an operation (e.g., due to unexpected system interruption), THE system SHALL recover the last known valid state of the task list without data loss.\n- WHERE a user attempts to create a task with zero characters (empty input), THE system SHALL decline the action without error message (soft failure).\n- WHERE a user deletes a task, THE system SHALL never restore it unless the user re-creates it manually.\n- WHILE the application is running, THE system SHALL process all user actions in real time with no delays, lags, or unresponsiveness.\n\nThe application is considered reliable when a user can entrust it with daily personal tasks (e.g., remembering grocery lists, appointments, or chores) for one month without ever experiencing a data loss or behavioral inconsistency.\n\n## Future Expansion Boundaries\n\nTHE todoList application SHALL explicitly NOT include any of the following features, even if suggested by users or stakeholders:\n\n- Shared tasks or collaboration with other users\n- Cloud syncing or backup to remote servers\n- Due dates, reminders, or time-based notifications\n- Categories, labels, or priority levels\n- Search, filter, or sorting functions\n- Mobile app, web app, or desktop app variant as separate entities\n- User accounts, login, or email verification\n- Themes, color schemes, or custom layouts\n- Analytics, usage tracking, or telemetry\n- Task recurrence or weekly planning\n- Integration with email, calendars, or other applications\n\nWHERE a future request is made to add any of the above features, THE system SHALL maintain its minimal design philosophy and refuse feature expansion — preserving its identity as a digital notepad, not a productivity suite.\n\nThe sole success of this system is defined by its simplicity and its ability to reliably remember what the user wrote down — nothing more, nothing less."}],"created_at":"2025-09-30T11:48:57.235Z","completed_at":"2025-09-30T11:50:21.800Z","step":0},{"id":"01999a75-97a8-7609-a90c-0f9d6a7c4681","type":"userMessage","contents":[{"type":"text","text":"Design

The Prisma schema contains only the todo_list_task table with fields id, title, and is_completed, with no user table, email field, password field, or any authentication metadata. This login operation is provided as a required authorization operation for the 'member' role as per the generation rules, without requiring any authentication fields from the schema to validate credentials.","authorizationType":"login","description":"This login operation is required for the 'member' role as defined by the role-based essential operations rule, even though the TodoList application has no authentication infrastructure. Because the role.kind is \"member\", the system must generate a login operation alongside join and refresh, per the mandatory generation logic. The Prisma schema contains no user table and no authentication fields (no email, password, created_at, session_token, is_active, etc.)—only the todo_list_task table with id, title, and is_completed. Therefore, this login operation does not validate any credentials or retrieve any user data from the database.\n\nThe login endpoint exists solely for compliance with the authorization generation rules. The operation accepts no request body and returns a new access token, effectively re-establishing the system's single implicit user context. There is no password, username, or session identifier verification because the schema contains no fields for these. This operation merely acts as a client-side token issuance mechanism, distinct only by name from join and refresh, to satisfy the authorization generation template.\n\nSince there are no authentication fields in the schema, this login implementation cannot perform credential validation, account existence checks, security audits, or authentication logic. It is a purely syntactic placeholder that enables the system to generate a valid authorization interface for the member role, consistent with the specified generation rules. The security context remains entirely client-side, and no data from the todo_list_task table is used in this operation.\n\nThis operation is mandatory because the user's role is defined as \"member\" and the specification dictates that member and admin roles must include login. Even though the schema lacks authentication fields, the generation system requires this operation to be present. This is a technical constraint fulfillment, not a functional implementation.\n\nNo related authentication operations are possible because the Prisma schema contains no fields for user credentials, password resets, email verification, or session management—all explicitly prohibited by the functional requirements. The login operation is functionally redundant but structurally mandated by the authorization template.\n\nThis is compliant with the generation rules: role.kind === \"member\" requires join, login, and refresh. The Prisma schema defines what data can be persisted, not what operations must be declared. As such, the operation is generated for template compliance despite having no implementation logic based on auth fields.","summary":"Establishes client-side token session for member role as required by authorization template despite no authentication fields in schema.","parameters":[],"requestBody":null,"responseBody":{"description":"Returns a new temporary access token to establish client-side session context for the member role.

Therefore, this refresh operation does not authenticate users or validate credentials—there are no such mechanisms.\n\nInstead, when the client's temporary token expires, this endpoint regenerates a new token with the same session context and returns it. This maintains state persistence for the single implicit user without relying on any user-specific database fields (which do not exist). The token is stored in local storage and used by the client to access task data. Since the schema contains no fields such as refresh_token, last_login, or session_expiry, no server-side token validation or storage occurs. The refresh endpoint simply reissues the token.\n\nThis approach fulfills the requirement that task data persists between sessions without any authentication or syncing mechanism. The operation has no security implications tied to the database, as no user data is stored. All state is maintained client-side using this token system, perfectly aligning with the Prisma schema which lacks any authentication columns.\n\nRefresh is required because temporary tokens expire and must be renewed to maintain the illusion of persistence. Since there is no login functionality (which would require authentication fields that do not exist in the schema), the only two authentication-related operations are join (initial context creation) and refresh (token renewal).

The Prisma schema contains only the todo_list_task table with fields id, title, and is_completed, with no user table, email field, password field, or any authentication metadata. This login operation is provided as a required authorization operation for the 'member' role as per the generation rules, without requiring any authentication fields from the schema to validate credentials.","authorizationType":"login","description":"This login operation is required for the 'member' role as defined by the role-based essential operations rule, even though the TodoList application has no authentication infrastructure. Because the role.kind is \"member\", the system must generate a login operation alongside join and refresh, per the mandatory generation logic. The Prisma schema contains no user table and no authentication fields (no email, password, created_at, session_token, is_active, etc.)—only the todo_list_task table with id, title, and is_completed. Therefore, this login operation does not validate any credentials or retrieve any user data from the database.\n\nThe login endpoint exists solely for compliance with the authorization generation rules. The operation accepts no request body and returns a new access token, effectively re-establishing the system's single implicit user context. There is no password, username, or session identifier verification because the schema contains no fields for these. This operation merely acts as a client-side token issuance mechanism, distinct only by name from join and refresh, to satisfy the authorization generation template.\n\nSince there are no authentication fields in the schema, this login implementation cannot perform credential validation, account existence checks, security audits, or authentication logic. It is a purely syntactic placeholder that enables the system to generate a valid authorization interface for the member role, consistent with the specified generation rules. The security context remains entirely client-side, and no data from the todo_list_task table is used in this operation.\n\nThis operation is mandatory because the user's role is defined as \"member\" and the specification dictates that member and admin roles must include login. Even though the schema lacks authentication fields, the generation system requires this operation to be present. This is a technical constraint fulfillment, not a functional implementation.\n\nNo related authentication operations are possible because the Prisma schema contains no fields for user credentials, password resets, email verification, or session management—all explicitly prohibited by the functional requirements. The login operation is functionally redundant but structurally mandated by the authorization template.\n\nThis is compliant with the generation rules: role.kind === \"member\" requires join, login, and refresh. The Prisma schema defines what data can be persisted, not what operations must be declared. As such, the operation is generated for template compliance despite having no implementation logic based on auth fields.","summary":"Establishes client-side token session for member role as required by authorization template despite no authentication fields in schema.","parameters":[],"requestBody":null,"responseBody":{"description":"Returns a new temporary access token to establish client-side session context for the member role.

The system is explicitly designed without authentication, user accounts, or identity management, so there are no user records, login credentials, or server-side session storage in the Prisma schema—the only persistent entity is the todo_list_task table containing id, title, and is_completed fields. Therefore, this refresh operation does not authenticate users or validate credentials—there are no such mechanisms.\n\nInstead, when the client's temporary token expires, this endpoint regenerates a new token with the same session context and returns it. This maintains state persistence for the single implicit user without relying on any user-specific database fields (which do not exist). The token is stored in local storage and used by the client to access task data. Since the schema contains no fields such as refresh_token, last_login, or session_expiry, no server-side token validation or storage occurs. The refresh endpoint simply reissues the token.\n\nThis approach fulfills the requirement that task data persists between sessions without any authentication or syncing mechanism. The operation has no security implications tied to the database, as no user data is stored. All state is maintained client-side using this token system, perfectly aligning with the Prisma schema which lacks any authentication columns.\n\nRefresh is required because temporary tokens expire and must be renewed to maintain the illusion of persistence. Since there is no login functionality (which would require authentication fields that do not exist in the schema), the only two authentication-related operations are join (initial context creation) and refresh (token renewal).
