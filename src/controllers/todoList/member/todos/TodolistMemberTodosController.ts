   * Create a new todo item for the authenticated user with a specified title.
   * This operation follows the business rules that require todo item titles to
   * be between 1 and 255 characters and not empty or whitespace-only. The
   * system enforces these validation rules at the API level before creating any
   * database records.
   *
   * When a valid title is provided, the system creates a new record in the
   * todo_list_todos table with the following automatic assignments:
   *
   * - The todo_list_member_id is set to the authenticated user's ID
   * - The status is set to 'active' by default
   * - The created_at timestamp is set to the current time in Asia/Seoul timezone
   * - The updated_at timestamp is set to the same value as created_at
   * - A unique UUID is generated for the id field
   *
   * If the title violates the business rules (empty, whitespace-only, or
   * exceeds 255 characters), the system rejects the request with an appropriate
   * error response without creating any database record, ensuring data
   * integrity.
   *
   * The system follows the security principle of data ownership, automatically
   * associating the new todo item with the authenticated user and preventing
   * any association with other users. This implementation allows for
   * independent task management without any collaboration features as specified
   * in the requirements.
   *
   * The operation returns the complete created todo item including all fields,
   * confirming successful creation to the client. The response includes the
   * generated UUID, title, status, and timestamps, enabling the client to
   * immediately display the new task in the user interface.

  /**
   * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of todo items for the

   *
   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of todo items belonging to the
   * authenticated user. This operation enables users to search through their
   * personal task list using multiple criteria including status filtering,
   * partial title matching, and date range queries. The system ensures strict
   * data ownership by automatically filtering results to include only todo
   * items associated with the authenticated user's ID.
   *
   * The operation supports partial text matching on titles using PostgreSQL
   * trigram operations for efficient fuzzy searching. Users can search for
   * tasks containing specific phrases, and the results are returned in order of
   * relevance. Status filtering allows users to view only active tasks, only
   * completed tasks, or all tasks. Results are sorted by creation date in
   * descending order (newest first) by default.
   *
   * This operation fully supports pagination with configurable page sizes and
   * cursor-based navigation. Each response includes metadata about total count
   * and pagination state, allowing clients to implement infinite scrolling or
   * page navigation interfaces.
   *
   * Security considerations include rate limiting for search operations and
   * immediate rejection of requests attempting to access todo items not owned
   * by the authenticated user. The implementation enforces row-level security
   * at the database level, ensuring that users cannot access or even determine
   * the existence of todo items belonging to other users.
   *
   * This operation integrates with the todo_list_todos table as defined in the
   * Prisma schema, incorporating all available todo fields and relationships.
   * The response includes comprehensive todo information optimized for list
   * displays, with no unnecessary data transfer.

  /**
   * Permanently delete all todo items for the authenticated member.
   *
   * This operation permanently removes every todo item owned by the
   * authenticated member. Unlike individual item deletion, this is a bulk
   * deletion operation that removes all records from the todo_list_todos table
   * that are linked to the authenticated user's ID. As the Prisma schema does
   * not include any soft delete fields (like deleted_at) on the todo_list_todos
   * model, this is a hard delete - the data is completely and irreversibly
   * removed from the database. There is no recovery mechanism, and no archives
   * are maintained.
   *
   * The operation does not require a request body. It is triggered by the
   * endpoint and applies exclusively to the authenticated user's data, as all
   * todo items in the database are linked to a member via the
   * todo_list_member_id foreign key. The system automatically enforces
   * ownership by only allowing deletion of items belonging to the user
   * associated with the authentication token.
   *
   * This endpoint supports the business rule that users can permanently clear
   * their completed tasks, and extends it to allow clearing all tasks (both
   * active and completed) in a single action. It is used for data clean-up when
   * a user wishes to start over. Given the system's design of single-user,
   * personal task management with no collaboration features, no cascading
   * deletions or orphaned references exist.
   *
   * This delete operation is therefore both simple and absolute -- when
   * executed, it removes every todo item the user has ever created, in
   * compliance with the requirement that data must be stored solely on the
   * user's device and not preserved in any external or recovery-enabled form.

   * The system maintains strict data ownership by validating that the todo

   *
   * This operation allows an authenticated member to modify the title or status

   * the todo item's todo_list_member_id matches the authenticated user's ID. If
   * the status is being changed, it must toggle between 'active' and
   * 'completed'; any other status value is rejected. If the title is being
   * updated, it must be between 1 and 255 non-whitespace characters, and

   * cannot have their titles edited. Upon successful update, the updated_at
