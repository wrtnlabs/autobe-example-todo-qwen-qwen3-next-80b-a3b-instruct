   * table. When a user registers, they provide an email address and password
   * which are securely stored.
   *
   * The schema confirms this operation is supported by the existence of 'email'
   * and 'password_hash' fields in the todo_list_members table, which store the
   * user's login credentials. The 'created_at' field is automatically populated
   * with the current timestamp in Asia/Seoul timezone.
   *
   * The system enforces unique email addresses to prevent duplicate account
   * creation. The password_hash is stored using bcrypt algorithm with cost
   * factor 12 as specified in the schema description. No other fields are
   * required for registration.
   *
   * The registration flow is the first step in the authentication process for
   * members. After successful registration, the system will need to create a
   * corresponding todo_list_member_roles record to assign the 'member' role.
   *
   * It's critical that email addresses are validated to ensure they follow RFC
   * 5322 format, and passwords meet the minimum security requirements as
   * defined in the schema.

  /**
   * Authenticate member user and issue JWT access token using email and
   * password hash from todo_list_members table.
   *
   * This API operation authenticates member users by validating their
   * credentials against the todo_list_members table. When a user attempts to
   * log in, the system checks if an email exists in the database and if the
   * provided password_hash matches the stored value using bcrypt algorithm.
   *
   * The schema confirms this operation is supported by the 'email' and
   * 'password_hash' fields in the todo_list_members table, which store user
   * credentials. The 'created_at' and 'updated_at' fields are used for session
   * management and inactivity timeout logic.
   *
   * The system implements security best practices by not disclosing whether an
   * email exists in the system when authentication fails. It implements a
   * 30-minute session timeout as specified in the business requirements, where
   * the issued JWT token expires after 30 minutes.
   *
   * This operation is essential for member users to access their todo items.
   * After successful authentication, the user receives a JWT token containing
   * their userId and role information (member). The token must be included in
   * subsequent requests to authorize access to private resources.
   *
   * The authentication process follows the security compliance requirements: no
   * password data is transmitted in plain text, and all communication uses
   * HTTPS/TLS 1.2+.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Contains the email address and password hash for authenticating
   *   a member user.

  /**
   * Refresh JWT access token for member user using a valid refresh token.
   *
   * This API operation refreshes the authentication token for member users by
   * validating a refresh token and issuing a new JWT access token. The refresh
   * token is a separate long-lived credential that is issued during the login
   * process, and its purpose is to allow the user to obtain a new access token
   * without re-entering their credentials.
   *
   * Although the todo_list_members schema does not explicitly store refresh
   * tokens, the refresh operation is implemented as part of the authentication
   * workflow following industry standards. The refresh mechanism operates by
   * validating the refresh token's signature and issuer, then issuing a new
   * access token.
   *
   * The system follows the session management requirements, including a
   * 30-minute session timeout. When a user's JWT access token expires, they
   * must use this refresh endpoint to obtain a new token before attempting
   * further operations on their todo items.
   *
   * The operation ensures the user's identity is consistent between the old,
   * expired token and the new token by using the user's UUID from the refresh
   * token. The refresh operation is secured, and the refresh token must be
   * stored securely on the client side.
   *
   * This endpoint does not require the user's password and is designed to
   * minimize user friction while maintaining security.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Contains the refresh token to obtain a new access token.
