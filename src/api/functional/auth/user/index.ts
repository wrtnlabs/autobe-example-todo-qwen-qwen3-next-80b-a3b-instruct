/**
 * Creates temporary session context for single-user TodoList application
 * without authentication or user records.
 *
 * This registration (join) operation creates a temporary token-based context
 * for the single user of the TodoList application. The system is explicitly
 * designed without user authentication, accounts, or identity management, so
 * there are no user records, login credentials, or server-side session storage
 * in the Prisma schema—the only persistent entity is the todo_list_task table
 * containing id, title, and is_completed fields. Therefore, this join operation
 * does not collect user credentials or personal data—it merely creates a
 * session context for local persistence. This is different from traditional
 * systems where join operations create user records; here, no user record
 * exists in the database.
 *
 * The operation returns a token that correlates with a local storage key,
 * allowing the client to retrieve and modify tasks. Since no user table exists
 * in Prisma schema, no user-specific data is stored—only task data in
 * todo_list_task. The token is cryptographically generated and stored
 * client-side, not server-side, satisfying the requirement that all operations
 * occur under implicit user context.
 *
 * This join operation enables the system to meet the requirement that task data
 * persists between sessions without any authentication or syncing mechanism.
 * Since the schema has no fields for user_id, email, password, or any
 * authentication metadata, the session token is the only artifact needed to
 * maintain state locally. This operation is non-identity-based; it doesn't
 * create a user identity—it creates a persistent local context.
 *
 * Security is maintained through token secrecy on the client side, as there is
 * no server-side storage of tokens or user data. This approach aligns
 * completely with the Prisma schema which lacks any authentication columns.
 *
 * Since the system has no login, refresh, or session management schema fields,
 * the only required operations are join (to establish temporary context) and
 * refresh (to renew tokens). The single-user constraint makes any other
 * authentication operations redundant and prohibited by the functional
 * requirements.

/**
 * Establishes client-side token session for member role as required by
 * authorization template despite no authentication fields in schema.
 *
 * This login operation is required for the 'member' role as defined by the
 * role-based essential operations rule, even though the TodoList application
 * has no authentication infrastructure. Because the role.kind is "member", the
 * system must generate a login operation alongside join and refresh, per the
 * mandatory generation logic. The Prisma schema contains no user table and no
 * authentication fields (no email, password, created_at, session_token,
 * is_active, etc.)—only the todo_list_task table with id, title, and
 * is_completed. Therefore, this login operation does not validate any
 * credentials or retrieve any user data from the database.
 *
 * The login endpoint exists solely for compliance with the authorization
 * generation rules. The operation accepts no request body and returns a new
 * access token, effectively re-establishing the system's single implicit user
 * context. There is no password, username, or session identifier verification
 * because the schema contains no fields for these. This operation merely acts
 * as a client-side token issuance mechanism, distinct only by name from join
 * and refresh, to satisfy the authorization generation template.
 *
 * Since there are no authentication fields in the schema, this login
 * implementation cannot perform credential validation, account existence
 * checks, security audits, or authentication logic. It is a purely syntactic
 * placeholder that enables the system to generate a valid authorization
 * interface for the member role, consistent with the specified generation
 * rules. The security context remains entirely client-side, and no data from
 * the todo_list_task table is used in this operation.
 *
 * This operation is mandatory because the user's role is defined as "member"
 * and the specification dictates that member and admin roles must include
 * login. Even though the schema lacks authentication fields, the generation
 * system requires this operation to be present. This is a technical constraint
 * fulfillment, not a functional implementation.
 *
 * No related authentication operations are possible because the Prisma schema
 * contains no fields for user credentials, password resets, email verification,
 * or session management—all explicitly prohibited by the functional
 * requirements. The login operation is functionally redundant but structurally
 * mandated by the authorization template.
 *
 * This is compliant with the generation rules: role.kind === "member" requires
 * join, login, and refresh. The Prisma schema defines what data can be
 * persisted, not what operations must be declared. As such, the operation is
 * generated for template compliance despite having no implementation logic
 * based on auth fields.

/**
 * Renews temporary session token for local state persistence in single-user
 * TodoList application.
 *
 * This refresh operation renews the temporary client-side session token used to
 * maintain state across browser sessions for the TodoList application. The
 * system is explicitly designed without authentication, user accounts, or
 * identity management, so there are no user records, login credentials, or
 * server-side session storage in the Prisma schema—the only persistent entity
 * is the todo_list_task table containing id, title, and is_completed fields.
 * Therefore, this refresh operation does not authenticate users or validate
 * credentials—there are no such mechanisms.
 *
 * Instead, when the client's temporary token expires, this endpoint regenerates
 * a new token with the same session context and returns it. This maintains
 * state persistence for the single implicit user without relying on any
 * user-specific database fields (which do not exist). The token is stored in
 * local storage and used by the client to access task data. Since the schema
 * contains no fields such as refresh_token, last_login, or session_expiry, no
 * server-side token validation or storage occurs. The refresh endpoint simply
 * reissues the token.
 *
 * This approach fulfills the requirement that task data persists between
 * sessions without any authentication or syncing mechanism. The operation has
 * no security implications tied to the database, as no user data is stored. All
 * state is maintained client-side using this token system, perfectly aligning
 * with the Prisma schema which lacks any authentication columns.
 *
 * Refresh is required because temporary tokens expire and must be renewed to
 * maintain the illusion of persistence. Since there is no login functionality
 * (which would require authentication fields that do not exist in the schema),
 * the only two authentication-related operations are join (initial context
 * creation) and refresh (token renewal). Both serve purely local state
 * maintenance for the single-user context defined in the requirements.
 *
 * No related authentication operations are possible because the Prisma schema
 * contains no fields for user credentials, password resets, email verification,
 * or session management—all explicitly prohibited by the functional
 * requirements.
